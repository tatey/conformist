# Conformist 

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tatey/conformist.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tatey/conformist)

Bend CSVs to your will with declarative schemas. Map one or many columns, preprocess cells and lazily enumerate. Declarative schemas are easier to understand, quicker to setup and independent of I/O. Use [CSV](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html) (Formally [FasterCSV](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastercsv)), [Spreadsheet](https://rubygems.org/gems/spreadsheet) or any array of array-like data structure.

## Quick and Dirty Examples

Open a CSV file and declare a schema. A schema is defined by `column` definitions which represent the input. Column definitions take an arbitary name followed by its position in the input. By default the schema assumes that the column ordering represents the ordering of the input.

``` ruby
require 'conformist'
require 'csv'

csv    = CSV.open '~/transmitters.csv'
schema = Conformist.new do
  column :callsign
  column :latitude
  column :longitude
  column :name do |value|
    value.upcase
  end
end
```

Insert the transmitters into a SQLite database.

``` ruby
require 'sqlite3'

db = SQLite3::Database.new 'transmitters.db'
schema.conform(csv).each do |transmitter|
  db.execute "INSERT INTO transmitters (callsign, ...) VALUES ('#{transmitter.callsign}', ...);"
end
```

Only insert the transmitters with the name "Mount Cooth-tha" using ActiveRecord or DataMapper.

``` ruby
transmitters = schema.conform(csv).select do |transmitter|
  transmitter.name == 'Mount Coot-tha'
end
transmitter.each do |transmitter|
  Transmitter.create! transmitter.attributes
end
```

Source from multiple, different input files and insert transmitters together into a single database.

``` ruby
require 'conformist'
require 'csv'
require 'sqlite3'

au_schema = Conformist.new do
  column :callsign, 8
  column :latitude, 10
end
us_schema = Conformist.new do
  column :callsign, 1
  column :latitude, 1, 2, 3
end

au_csv = CSV.open '~/au/transmitters.csv'
us_csv = CSV.open '~/us/transmitters.csv'

db = SQLite3::Database.new 'transmitters.db'

[au_schema.conform(au_csv), us_schema.conform(us_csv)].each do |schema|
  schema.each do |transmitter|
    db.execute "INSERT INTO transmitters (callsign, ...) VALUES ('#{transmitter.callsign}', ...);"
  end
end
```

Open a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and declare a schema.

``` ruby
require 'conformist'
require 'spreadsheet'

book   = Spreadsheet.open '~/states.xls'
sheet  = book.worksheet 0
schema = Conformist.new do
  column :state, 0, 1 do |values|
    "#{values.first}, #{values.last}"
  end
  column :capital, 2
end
```

Print each state's attributes to standard out.

``` ruby
schema.conform(sheet).each do |state|
  $stdout.puts state.attributes
end
```

## Installation

Conformist is available as a gem. Install it at the command line.

``` sh
$ [sudo] gem install conformist
```

Or add it to your Gemfile and run `$ bundle install`.

``` ruby
gem 'conformist'
```

## Usage

### Anonymous Schema

Anonymous schemas are quick to declare and don't have the overhead of creating an explicit class.

``` ruby
citizen = Conformist.new do
  column :name, 0, 1
  column :email, 2
end

citizen.conform [['Tate', 'Johnson', 'tate@tatey.com']]
```

### Class Schema

Class schemas are explicit. Class schemas were the only type available in earlier versions of Conformist.

``` ruby
class Citizen
  extend Conformist
  
  column :name, 0, 1
  column :email, 2
end

Citizen.conform [['Tate', 'Johnson', 'tate@tatey.com']]
```

### Conform

Conform is the principle method for lazily applying a schema to the given input.

``` ruby
enumerator = schema.conform CSV.open('~/file.csv')
enumerator.each do |row|
  puts row.attributes
end
```

#### Input

`#conform` expects any object that responds to `#each` to return an array-like object.

``` ruby
CSV.open('~/file.csv').responds_to? :each # => true
[[], [], []].responds_to? :each           # => true
```

#### Enumerator

`#conform` is lazy, returning an [Enumerator](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerator.html). Input is not parsed until you call `#each`, `#map` or any method defined in [Enumerable](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html). That means schemas can be assigned now and evaluated later. `#each` has the lowest memory footprint because it does not build a collection.

#### Struct

The argument passed into the block is a struct-like object. You can access columns as methods or keys. Columns were only accessible as keys in earlier versions of Conformist. Methods are now the preferred syntax.

``` ruby
citizen[:name] # => "Tate Johnson"
citizen.name   # => "Tate Johnson"
```

For convenience the `#attributes` method returns a hash of key-value pairs suitable for creating ActiveRecord or DataMapper records.

``` ruby
citizen.attributes # => {:name => "Tate Johnson", :email => "tate@tatey.com"}
```

### One Column

Maps the first column in the input file to `:first_name`. Column indexing starts at zero.

``` ruby
column :first_name, 0
```

### Many Columns

Maps the first and second columns in the input file to `:name`.

``` ruby
column :name, 0, 1
```

Indexing is completely arbitrary and you can map any combination.

``` ruby
column :name_and_city 0, 1, 2
```

Many columns are implicitly concatenated. Behaviour can be changed by passing a block. See *preprocessing*.

### Preprocessing

Sometimes values need to be manipulated before they're conformed. Passing a block gets access to values. The return value of the block becomes the conformed output.

``` ruby
column :name, 0, 1 do |values|
  values.map(&:upcase) * ' '
end
```

Works with one column too. Instead of getting a collection of objects, one object is passed to the block.

``` ruby
column :first_name, 0 do |value|
  value.upcase
end
```

### Virtual Columns

Virtual columns are not sourced from input. Omit the index to create a virtual column. Like real columns, virtual columns are included in the conformed output.

``` ruby
column :day do 
  1
end
```

### Inheritance

Inheriting from a schema gives access to all of the parent schema's columns.

#### Anonymous Schema

Anonymous inheritance takes inspiration from Ruby's syntax for [instantiating new classes](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Class.html#method-c-new).

``` ruby
parent = Conformist.new do
  column :name, 0, 1
end

child = Conformist.new parent do
  column :category do
    'Child'
  end
end
```

#### Class Schema

Classical inheritance works as expected.

``` ruby
class Parent
  extend Conformist

  column :name, 0, 1
end

class Child < Parent
  column :category do
    'Child'
  end
end
```

## Upgrading from <= 0.0.3 to >= 0.1.0

Where previously you had

``` ruby
class Citizen
  include Conformist::Base

  column :name, 0, 1
end

Citizen.load('~/file.csv').foreach do |citizen|
  # ...
end
```

You should now do

``` ruby
require 'fastercsv'

class Citizen
  extend Conformist

  column :name, 0, 1
end

Citizen.conform(FasterCSV.open('~/file.csv')).each do |citizen|
  # ...
end
```

See CHANGELOG.md for a full list of changes.

## Motivation

Motivation for this project came from the desire to simplify importing data from various government organisations into [Antenna Mate](http://antennamate.com). The data from each government was similar, but had completely different formatting. Some pieces of data needed preprocessing while others simply needed to be concatenated together. Not wanting to write a parser for each new government organisation, I created Conformist.
